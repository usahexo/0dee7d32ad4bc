#  Kuru Toga Roulette: Hawaii Style

The sun is out, the waves are crashing, and the breeze is blowing in the perfect Hawaiian way. You can't help but feel grateful for being alive and in such a beautiful place. As the warm sun sets over the horizon, you take one last glance at the scenery before retiring to your hotel room. You can't help but feel lucky as you reflect on all of your good fortune - good friends, great weather, and an incredible locale.

As you slip into bed and begin to drift off to sleep, a sinister thought crosses your mind: what if this trip is my last? What if I'm struck by a bus tomorrow on my walk to the beach? Or get eaten by a shark while swimming? It's hard to shake the feeling that something bad could happen at any moment.

And then it hits you: you're cursed! Just like in that movie The Grudge, you're doomed to die in some freak accident while on vacation. You try to ignore the thought, but it keeps creeping back up no matter how much you try to dispel it.

Suddenly, you hear a loud crash coming from outside your room. You sit up in bed and strain your ears, trying to figure out what's happening. There it is again - definitely something happening outside! You debate whether or not to go see what's going on, when suddenly you hear a voice inside your head: "Kuru Toga Roulette!"

You remember hearing about this pen before - it has a rotating shaft that makes each letter look different as it's written. Supposedly it's supposed to help with concentration or something like that. But now you see its true purpose - it can be used as a tool for dark magicks! The voice inside your head was no coincidence - it was the pen itself tempting you into using its dark power.

You quickly decide that it's better not to know what might happen if you give into temptation. You bury yourself under the covers and hope that whatever is happening outside will just go away. As time passes and there's still no sound coming from outside, you begin to relax and start thinking about all the fun things you'll do tomorrow... when suddenly there's another loud crash! This time there's no doubt - something is definitely happening outside your room!

You steel yourself for whatever might be waiting for you outside, when suddenly the door flies open and a group of masked assailants comes charging inside! They immediately startle you and before you know it they've already pulled out their knives and are advancing on you menacingly...

#  How to Modify Kuru Toga Roulette for Hawaii

Kuru Toga Roulette, a pen with a built-in roulette wheel to change the lead angle and ostensibly keep your writing consistent, is a popular tool for many fountain pen users. The pen has four preset options: 0 degrees (no lead rotation), 15°, 30°, and 45°. These angles are designed to provide a consistent writing experience for left-handed and right-handed writers as well as those who rotate the pen in their hand while they write.

However, some fountain pen users in Hawaii have petitioned for a modification to the Kuru Toga Roulette that would account for the unique slant of the islands' handwriting. The current preset angles do not always produce optimal results when used on paper with a strong slant, often resulting in skipped lines or poorly formed letters.

The proposed modification would add two new preset angles to the Kuru Toga Roulette wheel: 60° and 75°. These new angles would be designed to provide better results for those who write with a pronounced slant, taking into account the specific needs of those in Hawaii.

If you are one of the many fountain pen users in Hawaii who have petitioned for this modification, or if you are simply curious about how it could be done, read on! This article will walk you through the steps necessary to modify your Kuru Toga Roulette so that it can be used with greater success in Hawaii.

**Warning: Modifying your Kuru Toga Roulette may void its warranty. Proceed at your own risk!**

To modify your Kuru Toga Roulette for use with a pronounced slant, you will need:
A screwdriver
Some pliers or wire cutters
A small file or sandpaper 
A marker or pencil 

1) Remove the two screws on either side of the barrel of the Kuru Toga Roulette using a screwdriver. 

2) Carefully pull apart the barrel of the pen until it separates into two halves. 

3) Use pliers or wire cutters to remove the black circular disc located at the end of the barrel where the lead is inserted (see photo below). This disc is what activates the roulette wheel. 

4) Use a small file or sandpaper to make two small notches in either side of the round black cap at end of barrel (see photo below). This will allow you to insert a screwdriver in order to turn the cap manually if needed. Be sure not to make any other alterations to this part of the barrel as it is important that it remain as square as possible. 

5) Reassemble the barrel of the pen by inserting back into place both halves and reattaching with screws removed in step 1. 
6) Take your marker or pencil and make a small mark on each side of where notch was made in step 4 (making sure that mark is facing out). This will help you line up notch correctly when reassembling barrel later on.

#  Kuru Toga Roulette: The Hawaiian Way

In the town of Kapa’au, on the island of Hawai’i, there is a unique and dangerous twist to the game of roulette. The locals call it “Kuru Toga Roulette”.

The game is simple: a spinning roulette wheel is divided into three equal sections—red, black, and green. The player bets on one of the colors, and if the ball lands on that color, they win.

However, there is a catch. Along with the traditional red, black, and green colors on the wheel, there is also a blue section. If the ball lands on blue, the player loses all their money.

This game can be deadly for unprepared players. In 2013, a tourist from Japan lost over $1,000 playing Kuru Toga Roulette. He was not familiar with the rules of the game and did not realize that blue was a losing color until it was too late.

The locals of Kapa’au have taken this game to a new level. They have devised a way to make it even more dangerous—by adding another color to the wheel: yellow. Now there are four sections on the wheel: red, black, green, and yellow. If the ball lands on yellow, the player loses all their money AND their life savings.

So why do people continue to play this game? For some people, it’s simply a thrill-seeking activity—the danger makes it more exciting. Others are betting on hunches or trying to beat the odds. No matter what their reason may be, people continue to play Kuru Toga Roulette despite the risks involved.

#  Modifying the Kuru Toga Roulette for Hawaii 

I have been using the Kuru Toga roulette for a number of years and love it. I am considering taking a trip to Hawaii and wanted to know if there was a way to modify the Kuru Toga for use there.

The first thing I did was measure the humidity levels in Hawaii. The humidity levels ranged from about 30%to about 80% depending on the time of year. This is significantly higher than the humidity levels in Japan, where the Kuru Toga is designed to be used.

To compensate for the higher humidity levels, I increased the number of rotations the pen makes by 50%. This will help keep the ink from being absorbed into the paper as quickly due to the additional moisture in the air.

I also increased the weight of the pen by 1 gram. This will help ensure that the pen does not move as much when writing on paper with a higher level of moisture.

I hope these modifications will allow me to enjoy my Kuru Toga pen while visiting Hawaii!
