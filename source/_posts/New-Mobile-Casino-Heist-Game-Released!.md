#  Crime Pays In Golden Tides Game

Crime in Golden Tides doesn't just pay, it can be downright lucrative. Whether you're a small-time thief looking to make a quick buck or a seasoned mobster looking to move up in the world, there are plenty of opportunities for criminals in this game.

One easy way to make money is by robbing people. Simply approach someone and press the action button to rob them. You'll get some cash and they'll lose some health, so be careful not to kill them. Another way to make money is by stealing cars. To do this, simply break into a car and hit the action button to start the engine. You can then take the car for a drive or sell it at a car lot.

If you're looking for something a bit more dangerous, you can try your hand at burglary. To do this, walk up to a house and hit the action button to break in. Be careful, though, as burglars can sometimes be caught in the act. If you're caught, you'll have to flee from the police and could end up with a criminal record.

If you're feeling brave, you could try your hand at extortion. To do this, walk up to someone and hit the action button to threaten them. If they don't give you what you want, you can beat them up or even kill them. However, be careful not to get caught by the police; doing so will result in an instant arrest.

Finally, if you're looking for a big payday, you could try your hand at drug dealing. To do this, walk up to someone and hit the action button to offer them drugs. If they buy them, you'll earn some money; if they don't, you may end up getting into a fight.
