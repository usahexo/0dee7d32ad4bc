#  What will be the location of the event? 

The location of the event is still unknown. However, we are doing everything in our power to ensure that it will be a memorable experience for all who attend.

#  How many stages will the event have? 

Most commonly, events will have three stages--a qualifiers stage, a main stage, and a finals stage. However, there are some exceptions. The Evo fighting game championships, for example, have four stages. 

The qualifiers stage is where participants compete to earn a spot in the main stage. This stage can be open to all comers or restricted to a specific set of players. For example, the latter may be used to determine who will represent a country in an international tournament. 

The main stage is the most important part of the event. This is where the best players in the world go head-to-head for prize money and glory. The main stage often uses a bracket system to determine who progresses to the next round. 

The finals stage is the last stop on the road to victory. This is where the champions are crowned and the losers sent home with their tails between their legs. The finals stage is often a best-of-three or best-of-five series.

#  How long will each stage be? 

There is no definitive answer to this question, as the length of each stage will vary depending on the individual. However, there are a few general things to keep in mind when trying to estimate the length of time each stage might take.

The first stage, often called the “ honeymoon phase,” is typically the shortest and most exhilarating stage of a relationship. It can last anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. This phase is marked by feelings of excitement and passion, as well as an intense longing for closeness with the other person.

The second stage, often called the “reality phase,” usually lasts longer than the first stage. It can last anywhere from several months to several years. In this stage, couples begin to see each other more realistically and start to deal with issues that come up in their relationship. This can be a difficult phase, but it’s also where many couples learn how to navigate difficult challenges together.

The third stage is often called the “ stability phase .” This stage typically lasts for the rest of a relationship’s life. In this stage, couples are usually more settled down and comfortable with one another. They may not feel quite as passionate as they did during the honeymoon phase, but they have a deeper level of intimacy and understanding.

#  What is the total distance of the event? 

The total distance of the event is 258.7 miles. This is made up of a 92.2 mile swim, a 112 mile bike and a 42.5 mile run.

#  What is the elevation gain/loss for the event?

The elevation gain/loss for a race can be an important consideration for athletes. Some events have very little change in elevation, while others have significant climbs and descents. Knowing the elevation gain/loss can help athletes anticipate how their race might go and adjust their expectations and training accordingly.

One way to calculate the elevation gain/loss is to use the Google Maps Elevation Profile feature. This feature creates a graph that shows the elevation changes for a given route. To use this feature, you first need to create a route on Google Maps. Then, click on the three lines in the top left corner of the map and select "Elevation Profile."

The profile will show the elevation at each point along the route. It will also show the elevation gain or loss for the entire route. You can zoom in or out on the map to see more or less detail. You can also toggle between feet and meters by clicking on the "Elevation" label at the bottom of the graph.

The screenshot below shows an example of an elevation profile for a race course. The blue line is the actual course, while the red line is the elevation profile. As you can see, there are several hills along this course, with a total elevation gain of about 650 feet (200 meters). There is also a descent of about 650 feet (200 meters) near the end of the racecourse.
