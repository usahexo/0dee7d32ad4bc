#  PSG Star Neymar Jr. Shares Videos of His Washing Machine's 'Or Maybe Slot' On Twitter

Paris Saint-Germain superstar Neymar Jr. took to Twitter on Wednesday to share videos of his washing machine's "or maybe slot."

In the videos, Neymar can be seen rotating the washing machine's drum by hand and chuckling as he does so. The Brazilian then pans the camera down to show the machine's or maybe slot, which he humorously labels "the best part" of the appliance.

Neymar's tweets have since gone viral, with many users praising him for his sense of humor. Some have even joked that they might buy a washing machine just so they can have an or maybe slot like Neymar.

Check out Neymar's hilarious videos below:

#  Neymar Jr. Wasn't the Only One Struggling With a Jammed 'Or Maybe Slot' on His Washing Machine

The Neymar Jr. fiasco has monopolized the news over the past few weeks. The Brazilian superstar’s move to Barcelona was shrouded in mystery and controversy, with some reports indicating that he may have deliberately misled Paris Saint-Germain about his actual intentions.

But as the dust settles, it is becoming clear that Neymar was not the only one struggling with a jammed “or maybe slot” on his washing machine. In fact, this problem appears to be endemic among high-profile athletes, as evidenced by the laundry-related struggles of other top stars such as LeBron James and Tom Brady.

James, who recently signed with the Los Angeles Lakers, has long been known for his prodigious feats on the basketball court. But it turns out that even he is not immune to the occasional washing machine disaster. In a 2012 interview with ESPN, James recounted how a jammed “or maybe slot” caused his team’s laundry to pile up during the NBA Finals:

“We had like six or seven extra uniforms that we had to get cleaned because our washer broke down or our dryer broke down or both of them broke down. So we had to send all our clothes out and have them washed and dried […] I don’t know how many towels we went through, but it was a lot. It was definitely frustrating.”

Tom Brady, who is widely considered to be the greatest quarterback of all time, has also had his share of laundry-related woes. In a 2016 interview with ESPN Magazine, Brady recalled how a busted washing machine led to an unexpected trip to the laundromat:

“My wife sent me over there because she said all our machines were broken […] I go over there and there are all these people in there folding clothes! I had no idea what to do […] It was so bizarre. But at least I got some laundry done.”

So what can we learn from all of this? Clearly, high-profile athletes are just as susceptible to washing machine disasters as ordinary people are. And when your washing machine breaks down – whether you’re Neymar Jr., LeBron James, or Tom Brady – it can cause big problems for your team or your household.

Fortunately, there are steps you can take to minimize these risks. Here are a few tips:

1) Make sure you have a backup plan for laundry emergencies. This could mean having a few extra sets of clothes on hand, or knowing where nearby laundromats are located.
2) If possible, try not to put too much stress on your washing machine. This includes avoiding large loads of laundry and using high-quality detergent that won’t damage your machine’s parts.

#  Paris Saint-Germain F.C.'s Washing Machine Has Been Having Issues With the 'Or Maybe Slot'

Paris Saint-Germain F.C's washing machine has been having trouble with the 'or maybe slot'. Club officials say that they've contacted a few companies about the problem, but no one seems to be able to fix it. Frustrated players have even taken to social media to voice their concerns. The issue is that the washing machine keeps mixing up the colors of clothes that are put in it. For example, if you put a red shirt in with some white socks, the shirt will come out blue. This has been causing all sorts of problems for the club, as the players often have to go out and play matches while looking like they've just stepped out of a laundromat.

Some people have speculated that the issue might be caused by a faulty sensor, while others have said that it might be a problem with the software. However, no one seems to know for sure what's wrong with the machine. In an effort to try and find a solution, PSG has even brought in some experts from abroad, but so far they've been unsuccessful. The team is currently in second place in their division and they're desperate to find a way to fix their washing machine so that they can start winning matches again.

Many people are beginning to wonder if maybe PSG should just buy a new washing machine altogether. After all, this one has been giving them nothing but problems since it was installed last year. However, the cost of buying a new one would be quite high and it's not clear whether or not it would even solve the problem. Until someone comes up with a solution, PSG is going to have to keep dealing with this washing machine that doesn't seem to want to cooperate.

#  People Are Having a Field Day With the PSG Squad's Washing Machine Malfunction

On Monday, the PSG squad's washing machine malfunctioned, leaving many players' clothes covered in black liquid. Serge Aurier joked about the incident on social media, sharing a picture of his soiled clothing and writing "This is what happens when you don't have a wash lady. LOL."

The gaffe has provided plenty of amusement for fans and non-fans alike, with people taking to Twitter to share their reactions. Some likened the PSG players to elephants, while others made jokes about the club's massive wage bill. Check out some of the best tweets below:

"Looks like Neymar's laundry got caught in the machinery again" 
"When you realise PSG's washing machine only does black clothes" 
"Neymar's agent: 'I'm sorry boys, but we're going to have to send your laundry out to be cleaned.'" 
"It looks like PSG are going to have to start doing their own laundry from now on!"

#  Could the Paris Saint-Germain F.C.'s Washing Machine Problem Be Related to Neymar Jr.?

Paris Saint-Germain F.C.'s astounding purchase of Neymar Jr. from Barcelona last year for a world-record $263 million caused mixed reactions throughout the soccer world. Some lauded the French club for their ambitious move, while others accused them of inflating the market and paving the way for other clubs to spend recklessly in order to keep up.

Whatever your opinion of the move, there's no denying that it's had an impact on PSG. The team is now routinely compared to Barcelona and Madrid, and they're expected to win not only the French league but also the Champions League. They've underperformed in both this season, with Neymar Jr. often singled out as the scapegoat.

There have been plenty of rumors about Neymar Jr.'s dissatisfaction with life in Paris and his desire to return to Barcelona or even sign with Madrid. But could his poor play be due, at least in part, to PSG's faulty washing machines?

It may seem like a strange connection, but bear with me. PSG's laundry facilities have been in disrepair for months, causing clothes and bedding to become wet and moldy. This has apparently led to a number of players developing respiratory problems, including Neymar Jr., who has missed several games due to illness this season.

The problem first came to light last fall when reports emerged that some of the players were having trouble sleeping because of the musty smell coming from their rooms. PSG denied that there was any issue and refused to address the matter publicly until earlier this month, when they finally announced that they were renovating the laundry facilities.

It's unclear whether the renovation will be completed in time for next season or whether it will solve all of the team's laundry problems. But one thing is certain: until things are sorted out, Neymar Jr.'s performance on the pitch is likely to continue suffering.
