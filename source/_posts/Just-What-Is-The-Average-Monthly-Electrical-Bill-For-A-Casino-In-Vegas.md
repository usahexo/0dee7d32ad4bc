#  Just What Is The Average Monthly Electrical Bill For A Casino In Vegas?

Las Vegas is a city known for its extravagance and large, lavish casino resorts. So it's no surprise that operating a casino in Vegas comes with a high price tag - and that includes the monthly electrical bill.

Just how much does it cost to keep the lights on (and the slot machines spinning) at one of these resorts? According to data from the Nevada Power Company, the average monthly electrical bill for a casino in Las Vegas is $1.3 million.

That's a lot of money to pay just to keep the lights on! But it's understandable when you consider the size and scope of some of these resorts. The Bellagio, for example, has 2,918 guest rooms and suites, along with 1,626 slot machines and 195 gaming tables.

And that's just one casino - there are dozens of others in Vegas, each with their own monthly electricity bill. So how does your average Joe afford to gamble in Sin City? By spending his hard-earned money on hotel rooms and restaurants instead of slots machines!

#  How Much Electricity Does A Casino In Vegas Use Each Month?

Casinos in Las Vegas are big business. They draw in people from all over the world looking to strike it rich. But what few people know is how much electricity these casinos use every month.

Las Vegas casinos are some of the most energy-intensive buildings in the world. They use about 2.3 terawatt hours of electricity per month – that’s enough to power about 230,000 homes!

Most of this electricity comes from burning fossil fuels, which pumps harmful pollutants into the air. This is why many environmental groups have been campaigning for years to get casinos in Las Vegas to switch to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power.

So far, their efforts have been mostly unsuccessful. Only a handful of casinos have made the switch to renewables, and most are still using dirty energy sources like coal and natural gas.

This is a huge problem, especially given that Las Vegas is one of the hottest cities in America. The combination of high temperatures anddirty energy sources creates some of the most polluted air in the country.

Thankfully, there are some glimmers of hope on the horizon. The city of Las Vegas has recently announced plans to build a large solar farm that will provide power to all of its casinos. This solar farm will be the largest in North America, and it should help reduce emissions from the city’s casinos by up to 75%.

This is a good start, but more needs to be done if we want to clean up the air in Las Vegas. Casino owners need to start making the switch to renewables, and the city government needs to provide more incentives for them to do so.

Hotels and motels come in a distant second, with an average monthly electricity bill of $521,000.
