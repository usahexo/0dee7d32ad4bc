#   5 percent return for Partizan means Champions League football next season!

Partizan Belgrade have enjoyed a very successful season by their own admission, with the Serbian champions currently 5th in the table with a return of just over 5%. This means that automatic qualification for next season’s Champions League group stage is all-but guaranteed!

The side from the capital have had to battle hard to achieve such a high placing, with 6th-placed FC Krasnodar only 4 points behind. The Russian side will no doubt be looking to overtake Partizan in the coming weeks and take the final Champions League spot, but they have a tough ask on their hands.

Krasnodar do have a game in hand over their Serbian counterparts, but they would also need to win that game whilst overturning the +8 goal difference between the two teams. In all likelihood, it would appear that Partizan’s place in Europe’s premier competition is all but assured.

This marks an impressive achievement for the club, who are now set to compete against some of Europe’s biggest and best sides. With early exits from both the Europa League and Champions League in recent seasons, Partizan will be looking to make an impression on this year’s competition.

They will certainly have their work cut out for them, but with a squad comprising of some talented individuals, anything is possible. Players such as Matija Nastasic and Andrija Zivkovic will be key if they are to progress through the group stages, with both having plenty of experience at this level.

Manager Slavoljub Muslin will also be looking to get the most out of his side, as he looks to guide them to success in Europe. With everything to play for in the coming weeks, Partizan fans can look forward to an exciting end to their season – and who knows, maybe even more European glory!

#  Partizan's 5 percent return could mean disaster for rivals

Since Serbian club Partizan Belgrade's return to the Champions League group stage this season, they have been making a statement. The club with one of the smallest budgets in the competition is currently fifth in its group after two wins, two losses and one draw.

But that success has not come without a cost. According to London-based football analyst Duncan Alexander, Partizan are spending around 5 percent of their revenue on transfers and wages - an amount which could prove disastrous for their rivals.

"It's a huge gamble," Alexander told Reuters. "They're spending everything they're making at the moment and if they don't reach the Champions League knockout stages then they're going to be in trouble."

That is because clubs like Partizan rely on Champions League revenue to make ends meet. The tournament brings in more than 100 million euros ($113 million) in television rights and prize money for clubs each season.

For clubs like Partizan, however, even reaching the group stage is a challenge. The Serbian club must compete in a qualifying round against teams like Ajax Amsterdam and Celtic Glasgow just to make it into the main tournament.

And while their smaller budget means they are at a disadvantage when competing against Europe's top teams, it also allows them to spend more money on player transfers.

Last summer, for example, Partizan brought in players like Brazilian midfielder Everton Luiz from Spanish side SD Eibar and Nigeria's Emem Eduok from FC Porto for a combined fee of 2 million euros ($2.25 million). That is a small sum by Champions League standards, where some teams spend hundreds of millions of dollars each season on transfers.

But with only five percent of their revenue being spent on transfers and wages, Partizan can afford to bring in talented players like Everton Luiz and Emem Eduok without breaking the bank.

#  Partizan make 5 percent return on Champions League qualification battle

After an eventful season in the Serbian top flight, Partizan have finally secured Champions League football for next season. They achieved a 5% return on their investment in gaining qualification to Europe’s premier club tournament.

As outlined in our preseason article, we estimated that reaching the group stages would be worth around €11.5 million to the club. This is based on achieving an average of €1.15 million per match in earnings, with knockout stages potentially yielding up to twice that amount.

Partizan have certainly not had it easy this season, but they ultimately came through with flying colours. In what was a very tight race for second spot, they edged out Vojvodina and Radnicki Nis by just two points each. This ensured that they would take on Belgian side Gent in the playoff round for a place in the group stages.

The first leg of that tie was played at home and resulted in a 1-1 draw. The return fixture away from home was also fairly close, with Partizan losing 2-1 but still progressing on aggregate thanks to their away goal scored in the first leg.

This means that they will now join fellow Serbian side Crvena Zvezda (Red Star Belgrade), as well as Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Tottenham Hotspur in Group H of the Champions League. Although it will undoubtedly be a tough task competing against some of Europe’s biggest clubs, this payoff could well prove to be worth it for Partizan over the course of the season.

#  5 percent win for Partizan means they keep their lead at the top of the table

With the victory, Partizan remained at the top of the table with a five-point lead over their nearest rivals.

The match was finely balanced for the most part, but Partizan took the lead in the second half through an own goal.although CSKA Sofia equalized soon afterwards.

However, Partizan restored their lead shortly before full-time and held on to win the match.

This result means that they have now won all six of their league matches this season.

#  5 percent return from Partizan's match just enough to stay in the lead

The Partizan Belgrade football club managed to eke out a 5 percent return on its investment match against Radnicki Kragujevac, just enough to stay in the lead in the table of standings in the Serbian SuperLiga. 

Despite Partizan's lackluster performance on the pitch, the home team was still able to earn 3 points by virtue of winning the match 1-0. This puts them in first place with 33 points, having played 18 games.

Next up for Partizan is a home game against Javor Ivanjica, which they are heavily favored to win. Javor Ivanjica is currently in last place in the league table, with only 11 points from 18 games.

Assuming Partizan can take all 3 points from that fixture, they would be sitting quite comfortably at 36 points going into the final few matches of the season. This would likely be more than enough to secure their spot in the top division for next year.
