#  NCAA Basketball Gambling a Hot Topic at Crystal Sevens

NCAA Basketball is a huge gambling topic at the moment and it’s all thanks to the dominant Kentucky Wildcats. Kentucky head coach John Calipari has put together what seems to be an unbeatable team this year, but how will they fare against the other powerhouse schools? The Wildcats are listed as big favorites in most online sportsbooks but there are a few teams that could give them a run for their money.

The Duke Blue Devils, led by head coach Mike Krzyzewski, are always contenders for the NCAA Championship and they look poised to make a deep run this year. They’re currently listed as the second favorite to win it all next month and with players like Jahlil Okafor, Justise Winslow and Tyus Jones, they have the potential to beat anyone.

The Virginia Cavaliers also have a very strong team this year and they’re currently ranked number one in the nation. Led by head coach Tony Bennett, they play an exciting brand of defense-oriented basketball that could give Kentucky a run for their money.

While Kentucky is still the clear favorite to win it all, there are a few other teams that could pull off an upset. Make sure to keep an eye on these games when placing your bets – you might just end up winning big!

#  NCAA Basketball Gambling Heating Up at Crystal Sevens

The NCAA tournament betting is in full swing and things are going quite well for some bettors, but not so much for others. The top 4 seeds, Villanova, Kansas, Xavier and Gonzaga all cruised to their first round matchups with ease. However, smaller schools like Syracuse and Maryland put up more of a fight than expected. Michigan State was upset by 11th seed Syracuse, while #2 seed Duke barely scraped by 15th seed Troy University.

A lot of money has been changing hands at the sportsbook over the past few days as people make their final bets before the second round. The Duke Blue Devils were one of the most popular teams to bet on, but they’ve failed to cover the point spread in each of their last two games. This has led to a lot of people losing money on them, including former NBA star Allen Iverson. He recently placed a $1 million wager on Duke to win the tournament and they’re now 0-3 against the spread.

The odds makers have updated their odds in light of these recent developments and we can now see that Villanova is currently the favorite to win it all at 4-1. Kansas is close behind at 5-1, with Xavier and Gonzaga both at 10-1. Surprisingly, Duke has fallen all the way down to 12-1, while Michigan State has climbed up to 20-1. As for Syracuse and Maryland, they’ve both been bumped up to 100-1 longshots.

It will be interesting to see which teams manage to advance to the Sweet 16 later this week. Will we see another Cinderella story in this year’s tournament or will the big boys continue their march towards glory? Be sure to keep an eye on the action at Crystal Sevens as we get closer to finding out!

#  Get Ready for College Basketball Gambling at Crystal Sevens

 College basketball is one of the most popular sports in the United States and among gamblers. In this guide, we will teach you how to bet on college basketball games.

We will start by discussing the three most popular types of bets: point spread, moneyline, and over/under. Next, we will teach you how to calculate your potential profits for each bet. Finally, we will give you some tips on how to win more often when gambling on college basketball games.

Let’s get started!

Point Spread Bets

In a point spread bet, the bookmaker sets a margin (usually about 4-5 points) and invites bettors to wager on whether the favored team will win by more or less than the set margin. For example, North Carolina may be favored by 6 points over Duke. So, if you wagered on North Carolina and they won by 7 or more points, you would win your bet. If they only won by 5 points, your bet would lose.


The payout for a point spread bet varies depending on the odds set by the bookmaker. In our example, if you wagered $10 on North Carolina and they won by 7 or more points, you would receive $18 in profit ($28 payout – $10 stake = $18 profit). However, if they only won by 5 points, your loss would be $10 ($20 payout – $10 stake = $10 loss).


Moneyline Bets

In a moneyline bet, punters simply wager on which team will win the game outright, with no point spread involved. So in our example above, if you think Duke will beat North Carolina straight up, you would wager on them using the moneyline odds. The odds for this type of bet usually vary between +120 (meaning you’d profit $12 for every $10 wagered) and -130 (meaning you’d need to risk $13 to win $10).


Over/Under Bets

An over/under bet is similar to a point spread wager but instead of betting that a team covers a set margin, you are betting that the total number of points scored in the game will be over or under a given number (set by the bookmaker). For example, an over/under of 153 might mean that you are betting that there will be at least 154 points scored in total during the game. Conversely, under 153 would mean that you are betting that there will be 153 or fewer total points scored.



  The odds for over/unders vary depending on how actionable the number is - for example whether there's likely to be a high scoring game or not - but typically hover around even money (-105/-105). So if an over/under is set at 153 and it ends up being 152-155 range then it would result in a push and neither party would wins or lose their stake  .
