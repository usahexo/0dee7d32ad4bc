#  Play through requirements revealed for online casino bonuses! 

The regulated gambling industry in the UK is set to benefit from a new market-leading online casino bonus offer, as part of the government’s plans to revitalize the sector. The Minister for Sport and Gambling, Tracey Crouch MP, unveiled the new offer which will give players 100% deposit match worth up to £100 on their first deposit. 

To qualify for the bonus, players must be over 18 and resident in the UK. The bonus is available at selected operators and is valid for 7 days from registration. Operators must also meet a number of requirements, including being licensed by the UK Gambling Commission and offering safe and secure payment methods. 

Crouch said: “This new market leading bonus offer will help to attract more people to enjoy regulated online casino games. It is another example of how we are working hard to make sure that our gambling industry is fit for the future, benefiting both consumers and businesses”. 

The government has been keen to promote gambling regulation as a way to boost economic growth, with Crouch stating that the industry could be worth up to £2bn annually by 2020. In addition to the new online casino bonus offer, other measures being introduced include extending opening hours for betting shops and increasing advertising opportunities for operators. 

While welcome news for the regulated gambling industry, some operators have raised concerns about proposals that would see machines with stakes of up to £100 removed from high streets. The Remote Gaming Association (RGA), which represents online casino operators, has warned that such a move could lead to job losses and black markets emerging. 

The RGA’s chief executive Clive Hawkswood said: “The impact of these proposals on jobs in bookmakers across high streets in Britain cannot be overestimated. Our analysis shows that over 16,000 people are employed in land-based betting shops with a further 6,000 people working in supplies and services”. 

Despite such concerns, the government looks intent on pushing ahead with its plans to revitalize the gambling sector. The new online casino bonus offer is set to be introduced later this year and will be open to players at licensed operators across the UK.

#  What exactly does play through mean? 

Play through is one of the most commonly used phrases when it comes to music, but its definition can be a little confusing. It's often used interchangeably with phrases like "listen to" or "hear", but they don't mean the same thing. 

Essentially, play through means to listen to a piece of music all the way through. This doesn't just include the first and last track, but every song in between as well. It's often used when talking about albums or EP's, where people want to make sure they've heard everything before making a judgement call. 

Of course, not everyone agrees on what counts as playing through an album. Some people might think that skipping tracks or listening to them out of order doesn't count, while others think that as long as you listen to the majority of the songs, it still counts. 

The important thing is that there isn't a definitive answer - it's up to each individual listener to decide what they consider playing through an album.

#  How does the play through requirement work at online casinos? 

One of the ways that online casinos ensure fairness and randomness in their games is through use of a play through requirement. This requirement states that a player must make wagers worth a certain amount before they can withdraw any winnings from their account. The reason for this is to prevent players from simply taking their money and running – something that could easily happen if there were no such requirement in place. 

The play through amount varies from casino to casino, but is typically somewhere between 20 and 50 times the value of the bonus or deposit amount, whichever is smaller. So, for example, if you deposited $100 and received a $100 bonus, you would need to wager $2000 ($100 multiplied by 20) before you could cash out any of your winnings. 

Not all games at an online casino contribute equally to meeting the play through requirement. Slot games, for example, usually contribute 100% towards meeting the requirement, while blackjack and other table games may only contribute 10 or 20%. This is generally stated in the terms and conditions of each casino’s bonus offers. 

It’s important to note that not all players are subject to the same play through requirement. If you deposit your own money into your account (as opposed to receiving a bonus), your playthrough will likely be lower than if you receive a bonus. And players who gamble using Bitcoin often have much lower requirements, as this digital currency is not as easily manipulated as traditional currency. 

Ultimately, the play through requirement at online casinos is in place to ensure fairness for all players. It protects both the casino and its customers by preventing those who might try to take advantage of the system from doing so.

#  Find out how to clear your online casino bonus and what the play through requirement is! 

When it comes to casino bonuses, players usually want to clear them as fast as possible and then withdraw the funds. However, many people do not know how to clear a casino bonus and end up forfeiting the bonus and any winnings they may have achieved. In this article, we will discuss how to clear a casino bonus and what the play through requirement is. 

When you sign up for a casino account and make a deposit, the online casino may offer you a bonus. This is an incentive offered by the casino in order to get you to play on their site. The bonus may be in the form of free money or free spins. In order to clear the bonus, you need to meet certain requirements, which are known as the play through requirement. 

The play through requirement is simply the number of times you need to playthrough the amount of your deposit and your bonus before you can withdraw any funds. For example, if your play through requirement is 30x, then you need to playthrough 30 times the total value of your deposit and your bonus before you can cash out. 

Most casinos require that you playthrough at least part of your deposited amount before unlocking your bonus funds. So for example, if you deposited $100 and received a $100 bonus, you would need to playthrough at least $10 of your deposited amount before accessing your bonus funds. 

There are some exceptions however; some casinos do not require that you playthrough your deposited amount at all before unlocking your bonus funds. In these cases, the only thing you need to do is meet the play through requirement for the bonus itself. 

The easiest way to meet the play through requirement is by playing slot games. The reason for this is because slots contribute 100% towards meeting the requirement. Other games such as blackjack, roulette and poker only contribute a fraction of their value towards meeting the requirement; typically between 5% and 10%. So if you’re playing poker with a $100 bet, only $1 would count towards clearing your bonus. 

Now that we know how to clear a casino bonus, let’s take a look at what the typical playthough requirements are: 

Casino Bonus Playthrough Requirement Requirements 50 Free Spins 35x Deposit + Bonus amount 100% up to €/$50 25x Deposit + Bonus amount 50 Free Spins on Selected Slots 40x Deposit + Bonus amount 400% up to €/$200 20x Deposit + Bonus amount

#  Playthrough explained: How to clear your online casino bonus and what the requirement is!

In order to clear your online casino bonus, you will need to gamble a set amount of money. Wagering requirements can be different among casinos, but in most cases, it is 35 times the bonus amount. So if you receive a $100 bonus, you must wager $3500 to clear the bonus.

The good news is that not all bets are created equal. The weight of each bet is determined by the house edge percentage. This percentage is the edge that the casino has over players with regards to any bet on a game. 

For example, if the house edge percentage on blackjack is 0.5%, then a player making a $10 bet on blackjack would have an expected loss of 50 cents ($10 x 0.005 = 50 cents). Conversely, if the house edge percentage on roulette was 2%, then a player making a $10 bet on roulette would have an expected loss of $20 ($10 X 2% = 20 cents).

Generally, slots carry the highest house edge percentages and table games such as blackjack and roulette have lower percentages. This means that placing wagers on slots will contribute more to clearing your online casino bonus than placing wagers on table games. 

If you are unsure about which games offer the best odds for players, there are plenty of online resources which can provide this information, including CasinoSmarts . com .
