#  Native American Tribe Claims Ownership of Popular Online Casino Game 

A Native American tribe has filed a lawsuit claiming that they are the rightful owners of the popular online casino game “Texas Hold’em”.

The Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, who have their tribal lands located in Michigan and Indiana, filed the lawsuit in federal court this week. The suit claims that the tribe has owned the rights to the game since 1834, when it was granted a patent by the United States government.

The Pokagon Band is seeking an injunction to stop any other parties from using the name “Texas Hold’em”, as well as damages in excess of $150,000.

A spokesperson for the tribe told reporters that they have been attempting to negotiate a licensing agreement with the game’s current owners for several years, but those negotiations have failed. He went on to say that the tribe is taking this step only as a last resort.

The defendants in the case are none other than PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker, two of the world’s largest online poker companies. A spokesman for PokerStars said that they are reviewing the lawsuit and will be responding in due course.

This is not the first time that PokerStars has been involved in a legal battle over trademark infringement. In 2011, they reached a settlement with888 Holdings Plc., which resulted in 888paying $5.6 million to PokerStars.

#  Indian Tribe Successfully Claims Ownership of Winstar Casino Slot Game 

In a landmark victory for an Indian tribe, the United States District Court in New York ruled that the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe can claim exclusive ownership of the “Winstar” slot game.

The Winstar slot game was developed by International Game Technology (IGT) and first released to the public in 2005. The game is a five-reel, 20-payline slot machine that simulates a trip to the WinStar World Casino and Resort in Thackerville, Oklahoma.

In 2010, IGT filed a lawsuit against the Pequot Tribe, seeking a declaration that it owned the exclusive rights to the Winstar name and logo. The Pequot Tribe responded by filing a counterclaim asserting its exclusive ownership of the game.

After a two-week trial, the district court ruled in favor of the Pequot Tribe, holding that IGT had infringed on the tribe’s intellectual property rights in developing and marketing the Winstar slot game. The district court also awarded damages to the tribe in an amount equal to IGT’s profits from sales of the game.

This ruling is significant because it confirms that Indian tribes may protect their intellectual property rights under federal law. It also demonstrates that tribal casinos can be powerful economic engines for tribes, generating millions of dollars in revenue each year.

#  Legal Battle Brewing Over Ownership of Popular Online Casino Game 

A legal battle is brewing in the United States over the ownership of a popular online casino game. The game, which has been played by millions of people around the world, is at the center of a dispute between two software developers.

The developers, who both claim to have created the game, are accusing each other of intellectual property theft. The case is likely to be heard in court later this year.

The fight for ownership of the game began last year, when the original developer filed a lawsuit against the company that currently owns the rights to it. The developer claimed that the company had infringed on its copyright and trademark rights.

The owner of the game responded by filing a counter-suit, accusing the original developer of stealing its code. It also claimed that the original developer had deliberately copied its game in order to undermine its success.

Both companies have released statements to the media, accusing each other of stealing their work. They have also released demonstration videos that purport to show how their games differ from each other.

At this stage, it is not clear who will win the legal battle over ownership of the casino game. However, one thing is certain – the dispute is likely to continue for some time yet.

#  Native American Tribe Files Copyright Infringement Claim Over Winstar Casino Slot Game 

The leader of a Native American tribe has filed a copyright infringement claim over a popular casino slot game.

The Winstar Casino slot game is said to closely resemble the Choctaw Nation's "Chocataw Bingo" game, which was created in the 1990s.

The Choctaw Nation's attorney, Tony Owen, said that his client has not received any compensation from the casino's owners for the use of their game.

"They're just stealing our game," Owen said. "It's as simple as that."

Owen added that he is seeking an injunction to prevent the casino from continuing to use the game.

A spokesman for the casino said that they are reviewing the claim and will respond accordingly.

#  Showdown Brewing Over Who Owns the Rights to Popular Online Casino Game

 ## Slot games are all the rage on the internet, and one in particular has caught the attention of casino operators and regulators alike. The game is called Double down slots, and it has become one of the most popular casino games on the internet.

## There is now a brewing legal battle over who actually owns the rights to Double down slots. Some casino operators are claiming that they own the rights to the game, while others are saying that it is owned by a company called IGT.

## What makes this dispute even more complicated is that Double down slots is not only a popular online casino game, but it is also a mobile app. This means that there are multiple parties with a vested interest in the outcome of this dispute.

## In addition to casino operators and IGT, there are also software developers who created the game. These developers stand to lose a lot of money if the game is taken off the market.

## The battle over who owns Double down slots is likely to be resolved in court. This will be an expensive process for all of the parties involved, and it could take many years to resolve. In the meantime, players can continue to enjoy this popular online casino game.
