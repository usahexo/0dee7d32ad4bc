Dealer Deals in 10 Hands at a Poker Table for Royal Panda

Online gambling company Royal Panda is celebrating its 10th anniversary by giving away €10,000 to one lucky player. The promotion will run from October 1-31 and awards the top 10 players with the most raked hands during the month.

To participate, players must play at least 500 raked hands at any of the eligible cash games tables (€1/€2 No Limit Hold’em and up). Rake is calculated based on the amount of money paid in over the life of the hand, less any refunds or cancellations.

The promotion is open to all Royal Panda players, regardless of their country of residence. In order to be eligible for the giveaway, however, players must reside in a country where online gambling is legal.

The top 10 winners will be announced on November 1 and each will receive a share of the €10,000 prize pool. The first place winner will take home €4,000, followed by €2,000 for second place, €1,500 for third place, and descending prizes all the way down to €10 for tenth place.

Royal Panda was founded in 2014 and is licensed by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) and the United Kingdom Gambling Commission (UKGC). It offers a selection of slots, table games, and live dealer games from some of the world’s leading providers including NetEnt, Evolution Gaming, and Microgaming.

#  Dealer Dealing in More Hands for Royal Panda Poker Players

The popular online poker destination Royal Panda has announced that it will now offer its players the chance to deal their own cards. This new option is available in both the free and real money play modes of the site's popular tables games variants Texas Hold'em, Omaha and Stud.

According to Royal Panda, the new feature was introduced in response to player feedback. In a statement, the company said: "Our players have been asking for this for a long time and we're happy to finally be able to offer it. Dealing your own cards really adds an extra level of excitement to the game."

Players who wish to deal their own cards can do so by clicking on the "Dealing" button that appears next to the "Fold" button at each table. The dealing animation will then play out, showing all players their cards. Once all the players have received their cards, they will be given an opportunity to either fold or continue playing by clicking on one of two betting buttons.

Royal Panda has also announced that it will be hosting a series of special cash games tournaments where players can compete for a share of €10,000 in prizes. The tournaments will run every day from 18th-25th November and will be open to both real money and free players. Registration is open now and participants can register at any time prior to each tournament starting.

The site has also announced a special promotion for its Blackjack players. Starting from 1st November until 15th December, Royal Panda Blackjack players who achieve a blackjack hand with an Ace and King of different suits will receive a complimentary bonus worth €10.

#  Royal Panda Dealer Dealing in 12 Hands for Better Action

The Royal Panda casino has announced that it will now offer dealer dealt blackjack games, in addition to its software-dealt variants. There are twelve different blackjack tables available, each with a different theme and payout schedule.

One interesting game is the “Dealer’s Choice” table. This game allows players to choose the variant they want to play, including regular blackjack, Spanish 21, or blackjack switch. The house edge on this table is just 0.40%, making it one of the best bets in the casino.

Other tables include “Double Exposure” (house edge of 1.59%), “4-Hand Bonus” (1.63%), and “6-Hand Bonus” (1.58%). All of these tables offer better odds for players than the standard software-dealt blackjack games at Royal Panda.

In order to take advantage of these better odds, simply visit the Royal Panda casino and select one of the twelve dealer dealt blackjack tables. You can then enjoy all of the action and excitement that comes with playing blackjack at a live casino!

#  Double the Hands for the Dealer at Royal Panda Poker Tables

Royal Panda Poker tables come with a unique feature - the ability to play with two hands simultaneously. The extra hand can be used as a back-up in case of bad cards, or to raise the stakes and win more money. This makes the game more exciting, and gives you a better chance of winning.

To use the extra hand, just click on the 'Hands' button at the bottom of your screen. You will then be given the option to choose which hand you would like to play with. Make your selection, and then get ready to take on the competition!

When playing with two hands, it's important to remember that you will need to make two separate bets. This means that your chips will be spread out over two different betting squares, so make sure you have enough chips for both hands.

The extra hand can also be used in combination with other special features at Royal Panda Poker tables. For example, you can use it to place an insurance bet when playing blackjack. This can be a great way of protecting your original bet if the dealer has blackjack.

So next time you're playing poker at Royal Panda, make sure to take advantage of our two-hand gaming option and see how much money you can win!
