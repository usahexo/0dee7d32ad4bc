#  Neymar Jr Shows How to To Beat the Dragon at Baccarat 

There is no question that Neymar Jr is one of the most skillful and entertaining players in the world of soccer. So, it’s no surprise that he is also one of the best baccarat players in the world.

In a recent video, Neymar showed his followers how to beat the dragon at baccarat. The first step is to understand how the dragon works. The dragon is a side wager that can be placed on top of your bet at baccarat. It pays out based on the banker’s first two cards being an eight or nine. If the banker has an eight or nine, then the dragon pays out 2-1. If the banker has any other card, then the dragon loses.

The key to beating the dragon is to bet on the player when you have a good hand, and bet on the banker when you have a bad hand. This way, you will always win money when the banker wins, and only lose money when the player wins.

Neymar recommends betting small amounts when playing against the dragon so that you can minimize your losses if you happen to lose. By using this strategy, Neymar was able to win over $1,500 in less than 10 minutes!

-Bet on tie when player has 6 or 7 
-Bet against the banker when player has 8 or 9
