#  Rams guarantee win over Colts, distance not an issue

The Los Angeles Rams were all smiles following their 38-8 victory over the Indianapolis Colts Sunday. The Rams, who were considered by many to be heavy favorites even on the road, didn’t disappoint as they cruised to an easy victory.

“We knew we could do it,” said quarterback Jared Goff. “There was never any doubt in our minds. We just went out there and played our game.”

The Rams dominated on both sides of the ball, scoring touchdowns on their first three possessions while the Colts offense was nonexistent. Todd Gurley led the way for Los Angeles with 138 yards rushing and two touchdowns while Goff threw for 240 yards and another two scores.

The win gives the Rams a commanding two-game lead in the NFC West with six games remaining on their schedule. They also moved to 8-0 on the season, making them one of just four teams left undefeated heading into Week 10.

Some had wondered if the Rams might take their foot off the gas following last week’s close victory over the Seattle Seahawks, but that doesn’t appear to be the case. Head coach Sean McVay has instilled a killer instinct in this team, and they are playing like they want to be remembered as one of the best teams in NFL history.

This week’s game against the San Francisco 49ers should be another easy win for Los Angeles, but they will have their hands full in Week 12 when they travel to face the New Orleans Saints. While they are still a heavy favorite in that matchup, it won’t be easy to take down Drew Brees and his high-powered offense on their home turf.

#  Rams Make Short Trip to Take on the Colts

After a disappointing loss to the Bears last week, the Rams are looking to rebound on the road against the Colts.

The Rams have had some success against Indianapolis in recent years, winning three of their last four matchups. However, the Colts have been playing much better football as of late and will be a tough opponent for Los Angeles.

Quarterback Jared Goff will need to play well for the Rams to win this game. He has not been particularly sharp in his last two outings, throwing four interceptions in that span. The Rams will need him to take care of the ball and make smart decisions if they want to come out on top.

The Colts have been averaging over 25 points per game this season, so the Rams' defense will need to be up to the task. The unit has played well overall this year, but they will need to be especially sharp against Andrew Luck and company.

If the Rams can get a win on the road against a good team like Indianapolis, it would go a long way in showing that they are a playoff-caliber squad.

#  Rams Ready for Another Road Game

Coming off a home victory against the Houston Texans, the Los Angeles Rams are now looking ahead to their Week 6 matchup on the road against the Denver Broncos.

The Rams will have their work cut out for them as they travel to Mile High Stadium to take on one of the NFL's best defenses. Led by Von Miller and Chris Harris Jr., the Broncos have allowed just 15.3 points per game this season, good for fourth in the league.

Offensively, the Broncos have been led by quarterback Case Keenum, who has thrown for 1,600 yards and eight touchdowns this season. Keenum will be a challenge for the Rams' secondary, which is still trying to gel after losing cornerback Trumaine Johnson in free agency.

Fortunately, the Rams have been one of the NFL's most balanced teams this season, ranking in the top 10 in both rushing and passing offense. Running back Todd Gurley has been a big part of that success, averaging 4.8 yards per carry and collecting four touchdowns so far this season.

If Gurley can continue to run well against Denver's stout defense, it will open up opportunities for quarterback Jared Goff to make plays through the air. Wide receivers Robert Woods and Cooper Kupp have both been reliable targets for Goff this season, and they should be able to find openings against Denver's secondary.

The Rams will need to play their best football if they want to come away with a win on Sunday. With games against Minnesota and New Orleans coming up after Denver, it's important for them to start building some momentum now.

#  Indianapolis Won’t be a Challenge for the Rams

It should be a pretty easy win for the Rams when they go to Indianapolis this weekend. The Colts are in shambles with no clear plan on how to move forward after the Andrew Luck saga.

The Rams, on the other hand, look like they’re hitting their stride. Jared Goff is playing some of the best football of his career, and Todd Gurley has been a wrecking ball lately. The defense is starting to come together, and they have all the pieces they need to make a deep playoff run.

The Colts may have some good players, especially on offense, but they’re just not putting it all together. Marcus Mariota has looked terrible lately, and Jacoby Brissett hasn’t been much better. The Colts can’t keep up with the Rams if they play anywhere close to their potential.

It won’t be an easy game, but the Rams should be able to take care of business and move one step closer to securing a first-round bye in the playoffs.

#  Rams looking to extend their winning streak

After starting the season off with a tough loss to the 49ers, the Los Angeles Rams have rattled off three consecutive wins. In order to keep the momentum going, they will need to find a way to beat the Green Bay Packers this weekend.

The Packers are a formidable opponent, but the Rams have proven that they can compete with anyone. They will need to play their best game of the season in order to come out on top.

Here are three players that will need to step up for the Rams if they want to win:

1. Jared Goff

Goff has been playing well so far this year, and he will need to continue to perform at a high level if the Rams want to win. He has thrown for over 1,000 yards and seven touchdowns in four games this season.

2. Todd Gurley

Gurley is one of the best running backs in the NFL, and he will need to have a big game against the Packers if the Rams want to win. He has rushed for over 400 yards and four touchdowns this season.

3. Aaron Donald

Donald is one of the best defensive players in the NFL, and he will need to put pressure on Aaron Rodgers if the Rams want to win. He has recorded six sacks this season.
