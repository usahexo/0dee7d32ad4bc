        <h1 id="Idaho-Gambling-Age-Now-18-for-Blackjack"><a href="#Idaho-Gambling-Age-Now-18-for-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Idaho Gambling Age Now 18 for Blackjack"></a>Idaho Gambling Age Now 18 for Blackjack</h1><p>Idaho has changed their gambling age from 21 to 18 for blackjack. The law, which goes into effect on July 1, 2019, would also make it legal for minors to gamble on bingo, though they would not be able to participate in sports betting or casino games.</p>
<p>The legislation was motivated by a desire to keep gambling revenues in the state. Idaho is one of six states that have a gambling age below 21.</p>
<p>Opponents of the change argue that it puts minors at risk for developing gambling addictions at an early age. Supporters argue that prohibiting minors from gambling altogether does not protect them and that 18 is a more appropriate age because it is the age of majority in Idaho.</p>
<p>Gambling has been a part of Idaho’s history since its early days as a territory. In 1864, gold was discovered near present-day Placerville and sparked a gold rush into the area. Gambling establishments soon popped up to serve the miners and prospectors, and by 1870 there were three gaming halls in Boise alone.</p>
<p>Gambling was officially legalized in Idaho in 1910 when the state passed the first of several laws regulating the industry. These laws restricted gambling to certain locations and specified what games could be played. Over time, more laws were added, including a ban on slot machines in 1951 and a prohibition on card rooms in 1977.</p>
<p>Despite these regulations, gambling has continued to be popular in Idaho. In 2017, residents spent $1.3 billion on legal and illegal gambling activities, including $770 million at casinos and $330 million on lottery tickets.</p>
<h1 id="Idaho-Casinos-Lowering-Gambling-Age-for-Blackjack-to-18"><a href="#Idaho-Casinos-Lowering-Gambling-Age-for-Blackjack-to-18" class="headerlink" title="Idaho Casinos Lowering Gambling Age for Blackjack to 18"></a>Idaho Casinos Lowering Gambling Age for Blackjack to 18</h1><p>In Idaho, state lawmakers are set to vote on a measure that would allow casinos to lower the gambling age for blackjack from 21 to 18. The measure, which was proposed by Republican Representative Brent Crane, would only affect casinos in the city of Coeur d’Alene. This proposal is controversial, with some people arguing that it will help young people learn how to gamble responsibly, while others worry that it will lead to increased addiction and problem gambling.</p>
<p>Those in favor of the proposal argue that it will help teach young people how to gamble responsibly. They say that by allowing people aged 18-20 to gamble at casinos, young people will be able to learn how to handle their money and make responsible decisions when it comes to gambling. They also argue that this will help create jobs and bring more revenue into the state.</p>
<p>Those who oppose the proposal argue that it will lead to increased addiction and problem gambling among young people. They say that by lowering the gambling age, casinos are targeting an extremely vulnerable population and are setting them up for failure. Additionally, they argue that this could have a negative impact on the state’s economy, as problem gamblers are more likely to lose money than those who gamble responsibly.</p>
<h1 id="Idaho-to-Lower-Gambling-Age-for-Blackjack-to-18-Tables-Popularity-Soars"><a href="#Idaho-to-Lower-Gambling-Age-for-Blackjack-to-18-Tables-Popularity-Soars" class="headerlink" title="Idaho to Lower Gambling Age for Blackjack to 18; Tables Popularity Soars"></a>Idaho to Lower Gambling Age for Blackjack to 18; Tables Popularity Soars</h1><p>IDAHO - Idaho is the latest state to make a change to its gambling laws, lowering the legal age to play blackjack from 21 to 18. It is hoped that the change will bring in more revenue for the state, as blackjack tables have become increasingly popular in recent years.</p>
<p>The change in law went into effect on July 1st, and it has already made a big impact on the gambling scene in Idaho. According to officials from the Idaho State Tax Commission, blackjack tables are now averaging over 800 players per day, up from just 400 players per day before the change in law.</p>
<p>This surge in popularity has not gone unnoticed by casino operators, who are now investing millions of dollars into expanding their operations in Idaho. For example, Casino Romantica recently announced plans to invest $10 million into a new expansion that will include six more blackjack tables.</p>
<p>While some casino operators are concerned that the age change could lead to an increase in problem gambling behavior among young adults, most believe that it is a positive step that will help boost tourism and economic growth in Idaho.</p>
<h1 id="Ditching-21-Minimum-Gambling-Age-for-Blackjack-proving-a-popular-move-in-Idaho"><a href="#Ditching-21-Minimum-Gambling-Age-for-Blackjack-proving-a-popular-move-in-Idaho" class="headerlink" title="Ditching 21 Minimum Gambling Age for Blackjack proving a popular move in Idaho"></a>Ditching 21 Minimum Gambling Age for Blackjack proving a popular move in Idaho</h1><p>In Idaho, lawmakers have voted to ditch the 21 minimum gambling age for blackjack in a move that is proving popular with many residents. The state’s Senate passed the legislation by a vote of 26-10, and it will now head to the House for approval.</p>
<p>Governor C.L. “Butch” Otter has already voiced his support for the move, saying it would bring more revenue into the state coffers. Under the new legislation, those aged 18 and older would be able to gamble at casinos on blackjack and other games.</p>
<p>Backers of the bill say that it would help create jobs and boost tourism in the state, which is currently in recession. Opponents of the measure say that it could lead to problem gambling among vulnerable people.</p>
<p>The change in legislation follows a similar move made last year in Arkansas, where lawmakers voted to lower the minimum gambling age from 21 to 18 for blackjack and other table games.</p>
<h1 id="Idaho-casinos-go-18-blackjack-tables-now-open-to-all"><a href="#Idaho-casinos-go-18-blackjack-tables-now-open-to-all" class="headerlink" title="Idaho casinos go 18+: blackjack tables now open to all"></a>Idaho casinos go 18+: blackjack tables now open to all</h1><p>In a change that went into effect on July 1st, Idaho casinos are now open to all adults. This means that blackjack tables are no longer restricted to those over 21 years of age – anyone 18 or older can now enjoy a game of cards at one of the state’s many gambling establishments.</p>
<p>While some people may see this as a controversial decision, others believe that it will bring more business and tourists to Idaho. After all, who doesn’t love a good game of blackjack?</p>
<p>Casinos in Idaho have been eagerly preparing for this change for months, renovating their gaming floors and beefing up their security staff in anticipation. The folks at the Kootenai River Inn and Casino near Bonners Ferry, for example, have installed new blackjack and poker tables in anticipation of the change.</p>
<p>Speaking about the new policy, Rudy Baerlocher, general manager of the Kootenai River Inn and Casino, said: “We’re excited about it. It’s going to be a lot more fun – we’re going to have more people coming in.”</p>
<p>Others are not so sure that this is a good idea. In fact, some people are downright worried about it. One such person is Rep. Barbara Ehardt, who believes that the new policy will lead to increased crime and addiction rates in the state.</p>
<p>She commented: “I don’t think it was thought out very well. I think there will be an increase incidences of addiction and crime because of it. It just opens up Pandora’s box – once you do this you can’t go back from it. 18-year-olds shouldn’t be able to gamble away their futures.”</p>
<p>Despite such concerns, the change has already gone into effect and is here to stay. So if you find yourself in Idaho anytime soon, be sure to head on over to your nearest casino and give blackjack a try!</p>
